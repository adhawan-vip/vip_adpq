1. The request to create an article originates at [this button](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/480f3e4f97dfe0b11a0e59572c86c1263654441c/src/main/webapp/app/entities/article/article.component.html#L4).  
2. Clicking this button generates a popup where data can be populated and saved using [this button](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/480f3e4f97dfe0b11a0e59572c86c1263654441c/src/main/webapp/app/entities/article/article-dialog.component.html#L87).
3. The request is then routed to the typescript based Angular application component located [here](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/480f3e4f97dfe0b11a0e59572c86c1263654441c/src/main/webapp/app/entities/article/article-dialog.component.ts#L51).
4. The component invokes the UI-application's service layer's create method located [here](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/480f3e4f97dfe0b11a0e59572c86c1263654441c/src/main/webapp/app/entities/article/article.service.ts#L20).  
5. This routes the request to the server-side application's RESTful resource [located here](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/ef6503cbe32b276016d405ff6468c9e355be3cc1/src/main/java/com/trustvip/web/rest/ArticleResource.java#L87).
6. From the REST layer, the server side application code invokes the service layer [located here](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/ef6503cbe32b276016d405ff6468c9e355be3cc1/src/main/java/com/trustvip/service/impl/ArticleServiceImpl.java#L69).  Please note that the service layer component is an [interface](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/480f3e4f97dfe0b11a0e59572c86c1263654441c/src/main/java/com/trustvip/service/ArticleService.java#L18) and is implemented by the implementation class previously referenced in Step 6.  
7. From here, the framework components for persistence (JPA, Hibernate) are invoked and carry the data to the MySQL DB.
