# Knowledge Management Tool - VIP's Working Prototype
Our prototype is located [here](https://vip-adpq.herokuapp.com/#/).  Four roles types are supported and capabilities of each role is included on the landing page of the prototype (See "How to get around").

Credentials (username/password) for each role:
* Admin: admin/admin
* User: user/user
* Author: author/author
* Approver: approver/approver

We have included a video demo of core functionality located [here](TODO).

In addition, we have included a response to the core requirements/guidelines provided by CDT [here](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/master/docs/Requirements.MD).

# Technical Approach Narrative
## Requirement
*Vendors shall write a brief description/narrative, no greater than 2,000 words, of the Technical Approach used to create their Working Prototype and place this description/narrative in the README.md file located in the root directory of its GitHub repository. This 2,000 word limit applies to the Technical Approach description/narrative only.*

TeamVIP handpicked a small and versatile core team to develop the Knowledge Management Tool prototype. While most of our team was co-located in Sacramento, CA, we also had a developer located at our Reston, VA office to demonstrate our ability to collaborate using open source tools and within different time zones. We further augmented our team with a broad user base with different backgrounds, experience, and expertise; this team was dispersed across the United States and from different industries to give us a broad perspective. We chose this structure to demonstrate our ability to work as a cohesive group, and avoid potential groupthink or shortfalls of a small team by having a diverse user community to provide continuous feedback. 



## Requirement
*Documentation must show code flow from client UI, to JavaScript library, to REST service to database, pointing to code in the GitHub repository.*
## How We Met the Requirement
An example of the code flow is provided [here](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/master/docs/CodeFlow.MD).

## Requirement
*In addition to the description/narrative above, the Vendor must demonstrate that they followed the US Digital Services Playbook (visit https://playbook.cio.gov or see Attachment 2: US Digital Services Playbook) by providing evidence in the repository.*

## How We Met the Requirement
Our core usergroup was essential to our process from the very beginning and throughout the development. We closely followed the US Digital Services playbook to ensure the proper care and steps were taken to improve our prototype. We did continuous checks (daily scrum calls) to ensure we were aligning ourselves with the plays appropriately. How we aligned with each of the plays in the US Digital Services Playbook in located [here](https://github.com/adhawan-vip/vip_adpq/blob/master/docs/Playbook.MD). 


## Requirement

The README.md file should also make reference to the following: (a-t)
