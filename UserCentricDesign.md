#User Centric Design - Interviews

*TeamVIP Knowledge Management Tool (KMT) User Interviews*

Our interview process takes 15-30 minutes to complete, on average.
 
**What do we want to learn from the interviews?**

Our goal for this user-centric interview process is to avoid influencing feedback or unintentionally creating a groupthink mentality. We want to improve our product by soliciting feedback from actual users, identifying features that we may not consider otherwise.

Specifically, we would like to learn:

- What would a user need from a KMT at a State agency?
- What would different types of users require from the KMT?
- What potential issues would cause poor adoption of the KMT?
- How can our design positively influence adoption and utilization of the KMT?
- What benefits could be achieved from a KMT?
 
**How do we engage our interviewees?**

We provide a high-level background of our project, goals, objectives and encourage open and honest feedback. It is important in soliciting open and honest feedback that we choose open-ended questions, allowing the user to form their own opinions and recommendations.
We provide the below requirements as a guideline:
 
Knowledge Creation

1.  Shall have ability to easily create Knowledge Articles.
2.  Knowledge articles can be original records and/or packages of content
3.  Shall have ability to provide multiple levels and formats in Knowledge Articles (e.g bullet points for senior levels, specific scripts for junior levels)
4.  Shall allow for role-based security access/views
 
Knowledge Sharing

1.  Shall allow for promotion (sharing) of process and information across systems and channels.
2.  Shall have ability to create user-defined rules for creation and lifecycle management
3.  Shall trigger escalation processes (automated emails/texts to approvers) and send reminders to either approve or complete or publish activities.
 
Knowledge Development

1.  Shall have ability to update and improve Knowledge articles and access the value of usage predicting new records or record types
2.  Shall show innovation by learning from existing records (e.g. prompting to create new Knowledge Articles)
 
TeamVIP has intentionally left the KMT requirements high-level for the user interviews.  Our goal is to receive raw feedback from our users to better improve our product.
 

## Interview – Jennifer Salazar
 
### Interviewee:  Jennifer Salazar
Jennifer Salazar has over 10 years' experience working for the State of California. Jennifer has hands-on experience with sharing of knowledge articles, content, and packages at a government agency in different roles.
 
  
Jennifer's General Comments on the prototype –

*   Should be clean, visually appealing, laid out nicely - like that it is similar to CDT which sets the standard for agencies
*   Could be helpful to add a blurb about what the KMT is and why – people may be new to state or the tool
*   User/admin permissions is fluff, it would be better use to include what the tool is if space is limited
*   Site should be somewhat simple and generic – able to be rebranded for different agencies if needed

  
Detailed Interview Questions:
After reviewing the above general guidelines and thinking about how this may be used at a government agency, please answer the following questions to the best of your ability.
 
**What key features or expectations would you have from a KMT at a government agency?**

Biggest thing for government agency is to be able to tie to training (employee request for training – inside or outside career path – or mandatory/remedial training, etc.)

* Tie this to human resources and tie it to the individuals personnel file
* For example you can take a training but it may or may not attach to your file. When you think about performance reviews you want to demonstrate your knowledge and training
From a project or unit perspective – identify what is needed across the board for the project or unit.
* Be able to allocate budget – by setting up a budget you can see how it’s allocated. Only so much money to go around – technical staff may have requirements but so do clerical staff
* For many units or projects, training and budget is all over the place, uncategorized, not effectively tracked
* Being able to share training/knowledge gaps with management for a unit or a project is important
* Example is scrum training for everyone on a project
 
**What do you think most organizations and/or agencies lack in effective knowledge management?**

* Individual managers, their style, and tools available
Training can fall by the wayside unless its mandatory or being pushed from HR/central services

* Dashboard to show training vs planned or goal – individual and project level

* Being able to share this would be very important and is not done well at agencies today – reporting and dashboarding is up to the individual manager with lack of sharing of what works
Identify, track need through completion and be able to attach to personnel
 
**Related to #2, how do you think tools could help improve knowledge management in general?**

0.  Tracking, dashboards
1.  With the state there are annual career development plans and certain training requirements
2.  Automate or link to training requirements – notification each quarter – approved IDPs and make sure it is inputted into tools
3.  Ability to request training through the tool or highlight gaps and put a request in to managers
4.  What impacts everyone? Logging time, training, etc.
7.  Link to resources for developing training for career development
 
**What is it about government agencies in particular that makes a knowledge management tool important? That makes it effective?**

0.  Mainly training, dashboards
1.  Line managers to staff
2.  Mandated requirements that regardless of responsibility must meet (i.e. training) 

**What are the biggest pitfalls you would expect from the implementation of a KMT?**

0.  Another tool to worry about
1.  More time out of peoples day
2.  A tool like this would be welcome if it was easy to use and intuitive and helped accomplish a goal that takes time otherwise
3.  If it is not easy to use by ALL people of ALL Skills it will not be adopted
 
**What, if any, would you expect from reporting capability of the KMT?**

dashboards

**What would you consider critical in a proof of concept, prototype, or base version of a KMT?**

1.  It needs to work – if you click a button it needs to work or it will not get used
2.  Needs to have some functionality that is efficient/not cumbersome and couldn’t be done otherwise as easy (i.e. through email instead)
3.  If it can be a one stop shop, even if basic tasks or functions, it will be adopted
 
** What would you use the KMT for? **

0.  Training requests
1.  Reminders for requirements that are outside of day-to-day job demands
 
** What is one feature you would have on your wishlist if you were rolling out a KMT? **

0.  Comprehensive dashboard that could include rollup of a project or unit level – display individual staff levels too against a goal or requirement
1.  Needs to be easy to use and make managers look good
 
**What do you think we could miss in developing the KMT?**

0.  Biggest thing is making sure there are a couple layers of functionality – more than a wire frame
1.  Just enough to understand, see value, and demonstrate what the tool can do
 
**Additional user-specific questions: **

1.  How do you currently share knowledge in your organization?
*Tips, tricks, need-to-knows*
2.  Who do you typically go to when you have a knowledge gap?
*Peers, managers, mostly word of mouth*
*Also formal training*

3.  What do you envision when you think of a KMT? 
*training reporting system – use of staff and management*

4.  What approvals, reporting needs, or other governance considerations would you anticipate at your agency/organization with the introduction of a new KMT?
*Manager/supervisor approval*

5.  What would you consider a success when creating and sharing an article, content, or a package with your peers?
*Something that is easy to create and helps a lot of people answer the same question consistently.*

6.  Thinking of productivity tools at work (MS office, outlook, etc.), what is it about these tools that encourage your usage?
* Ease of use *
7.  Thinking of other online experiences you have (online shopping, searching for music, accessing online news, buying a car, etc.) what makes your experience enjoyable, and what is an example of a tool or service that you would consider exceptional?

*Ease of use, simple design, fresh ui, automation*

8.  What channels would you consider most important at your agency for sharing information (i.e. email, posting on the agency intranet, sms to mobile, etc.)?
*Probably email blast to certain DL lists*
